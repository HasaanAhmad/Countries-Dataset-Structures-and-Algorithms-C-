# Countries-Dataset-Structures-and-Algorithms-C++
Our program for countries data implements various data structures and graph algorithms to efficiently store and process information about countries. Here's a description of how we utilize different components:
## Lists: 
We use lists to represent and manipulate the country data. This allows us to store and organize information about countries, such as their country codes, longitudes, latitudes, and country names. Lists provide a flexible data structure that allows for easy insertion, deletion, sorting, and traversal of country data.

## Graphs:
We utilize graphs to model relationships between countries. Graphs provide a powerful representation for analyzing connectivity and proximity between countries. We can use graphs to determine which countries are adjacent or connected based on their geographical location. This enables us to perform various graph algorithms on the countries data.

## Hashing:
Hashing is employed to efficiently store and retrieve country information using their country codes. We use a hash table data structure to map country codes to their corresponding country data. Hashing enables fast lookup operations by reducing the search space and providing constant-time access to country information.

## Breadth-First Search (BFS):
BFS is applied to traverse the graph of countries in a breadth-first manner. This algorithm helps us explore neighboring countries from a given starting point and can be used to find the shortest path between two countries.

## Depth-First Search (DFS):
DFS is used to explore the graph of countries in a depth-first manner. It allows us to traverse the entire graph, visiting all connected countries. DFS is valuable for identifying connected components or performing in- depth analysis of country relationships.

## Dijkstra's Algorithm:
Dijkstra's algorithm is employed to find the shortest path between two countries based on their geographical distance. By utilizing the latitude and longitude information, we can calculate the distances between countries and find the optimal route using Dijkstra's algorithm.

##Prim's Algorithm:
Prim's algorithm is used to find the minimum spanning tree of the country graph. This algorithm helps identify a subset of countries that are connected and have the minimum total weight. It can be useful for determining essential countries in a region or analyzing regional connectivity.
Some other implement Data Structures are Heaps, AVL and arrays.

By combining these data structures and algorithms, our program provides a comprehensive solution for managing, analyzing, and querying country data. It enables efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of country information while facilitating various graph-based operations and analysis on the countries' geographical relationships.
